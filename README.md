# Event Organizer Website

Welcome to the Event Organizer Website, a project developed as Task 2 of my internship at Byteflow Tech. This website is designed to showcase the services of an event organizer, highlight their portfolio of previously organized events, and provide a means for users to request a callback. It's a fully responsive website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which enhances user experience by incorporating form validation, a dynamic slideshow, and overall smoother navigation.
